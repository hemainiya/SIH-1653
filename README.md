## Problem Title-Health Monitoring App
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
In today's fast-paced world, continuous health monitoring is crucial for early detection of medical conditions and proactive health management. However, traditional healthcare systems rely on periodic checkups, which may not be sufficient to detect sudden health issues.
This project aims to develop a real-time health monitoring app that collects vital health parameters using wearable devices. The system will utilize AI-based analysis to detect anomalies and provide instant health risk alerts. This will help individuals, caregivers, and healthcare professionals in making timely decisions, potentially preventing severe medical emergencies.

## idea
1.Real-Time Vital Sign Monitoring
Tracks Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), ECG, Body Temperature, and Stress Levels.
Syncs data from wearables via Bluetooth or cloud APIs (Apple Health, Google Fit, etc.).

2.AI-Based Anomaly Detection & Risk Prediction
Uses machine learning models to analyze patterns and detect irregularities in vital signs.
Predicts potential risks like hypertension, arrhythmia, or hypoxia before they become critical.

3.Instant Alerts & Emergency Response
Sends real-time notifications for abnormal readings.
SOS feature to alert emergency contacts or healthcare providers.

4.Health History & Insights
Provides visual graphs & trends to track progress over time.
AI-powered health recommendations based on historical data.

5.Doctor & Caregiver Integration
Allows users to share reports with doctors or family members.
Option for telemedicine consultation directly through the app.

## Use Cases
1. Chronic Disease Management
User: Patients with chronic illnesses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, heart disease).
Scenario: A patient wears a smartwatch that continuously tracks blood pressure and heart rate. If abnormal readings are detected, the app sends an alert to the patient and their doctor for timely intervention.

2. Elderly Health Monitoring
User: Senior citizens and their caregivers.
Scenario: An elderly person uses a wearable to track heart rate, SpO2, and body temperature. If an irregular heartbeat is detected, the app automatically notifies caregivers and emergency contacts.

3. Fitness & Athlete Performance Tracking
User: Athletes, fitness enthusiasts.
Scenario: The app tracks heart rate, oxygen levels, and stress levels during workouts. AI analyzes trends and provides personalized health insights for better performance.

4. Workplace Health Monitoring
User: Employees in high-stress jobs (corporates, factories, field workers).
Scenario: Companies provide wearables to employees for stress and fatigue monitoring. If excessive stress is detected, the app recommends breaks, meditation, or medical checkups.

5. Remote Patient Monitoring for Hospitals
User: Hospitals, doctors, remote patients.
Scenario: A hospital integrates the app with its system, allowing doctors to monitor real-time vitals of remote patients. If a critical condition is detected, doctors can take immediate action.

6. Emergency Response & SOS Alerts
User: Individuals with a history of heart disease or other high-risk conditions.
Scenario: If a patient’s vitals indicate a potential heart attack or stroke, the app triggers an SOS alert to emergency contacts and paramedics, sharing the patient's live location and health status.

7. Post-Surgery Recovery Monitoring
User: Patients recovering from surgery.
Scenario: A post-surgery patient wears a tracker to monitor vitals like oxygen saturation and heart rate. The app alerts doctors if any complications arise, preventing emergencies.

8. Preventive Healthcare & AI Health Predictions
User: General users interested in health tracking.
Scenario: The app continuously monitors vitals and uses AI to detect early signs of health risks like high blood pressure or potential cardiac issues, recommending lifestyle changes and doctor consultations.
